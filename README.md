In this file - we have six methods. The first method is the `AddCoin` method which just simply adds a coin to the piggyBankList and throws an exception if the coins added are more than 42 ounces which is the capacity of the coin jar.
- The second method it is the `GetTotalAmount` method which just calculates the total amount of the coins and returns the calculated total amount.
- The third method is the `GetVolume` method just calculates the volume of the coins in the coin jar.
